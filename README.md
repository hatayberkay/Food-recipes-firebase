Traditinally, Firebase projects does not need to add mobile Admin Panel. But, I added an one. Because , I do not want to open Firebase Project at web adress. So, I wrote an Admin Panel for adding texts and images to control all my content that in my mobile app.

You can see , "hatayberkay1234@gmail.com" that gmail account is mine. When I come in my mobile app. My app will be recognize me. After that , show me a litle button to making new content. ( I do not have to upload new Signed APK to Google Play. ) You change this address to yours.
